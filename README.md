# Unexpected Null Return in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions that involves unexpected null return values. The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers, but it returns `null` if either argument is `null`.  This behavior might not be intuitive and can lead to unexpected results in applications.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a solution that handles `null` values more gracefully.
